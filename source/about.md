I am currently a fourth year student at IIIT Gwalior. Currently pursuing a dual degree (B-Tech + Mtech) in information technology. With experience in developing and deploying web, android apps written with Django

When I am not spending my time coding / hacking , I am either surfing or spending time with my family. Maybe even surfing with my family (win-win). I live on the beautiful island of Oahu, but despite its beauty my final destination is the mainland of the US (good surf, no jobs). The reasoning behind this is both school (master's program) and opportunities. As a human being, I strive to be passionate, dedicated and kind. Thanks for stopping by!
